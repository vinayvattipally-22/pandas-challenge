## PyCity Schools Analysis
 This Python code performs an analysis on school and student data to provide insights into the academic performance of students in PyCity Schools. The code processes the data to generate various summary statistics, school performance metrics, and visualizations to aid in understanding the educational landscape.

## Prerequisites:
 Before running the provided Python code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

# Python:
 Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

# Python Libraries:
 The code uses Pandas for data manipulation. Install the required libraries using the following:
 . pip install pandas


## Data Files:
 This code assumes the presence of two data files, "schools_complete.csv" and "students_complete.csv," in a directory named "Resources." Adjust the file paths in the code as needed to match your directory structure.

## Statistical and Data Understanding:
 Familiarity with basic statistics and the structure of school and student data is essential for interpreting the results.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
 While the code can run in a standard Python environment, using Jupyter Notebook or an IDE like Anaconda can enhance your experience.

## How the Code Works

 # Data Loading:
  The code begins by loading school and student data from the provided CSV files using Pandas. It combines these datasets into a single DataFrame.

 # District Summary:
  It calculates various district-level metrics, including the total number of schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects. These statistics are presented in a summary DataFrame.

 # School Summary:
  The code calculates and presents a summary of each school's performance. This includes school type, total students, total budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.

 # Top and Bottom Performing Schools:
 The code identifies and presents the top and bottom performing schools based on the percentage of students passing both math and reading.

 # Math and Reading Scores by Grade:
 The code separates student data by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) and calculates average math and reading scores for each school and grade. Results are presented in a DataFrame.

 # Scores by School Spending:
  It categorizes schools into spending ranges per student and calculates average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects. These results are displayed in a summary DataFrame.

 # Scores by School Size:
  The code categorizes schools by size (small, medium, large) and calculates similar metrics as in the previous step. The results are presented in a summary DataFrame.

 # Scores by School Type:
  The code groups schools by type (charter or district) and calculates average scores and passing rates, which are summarized in a DataFrame.

## Running the Code
 Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites and data files in place.
 Copy and paste the code into your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
 Run the code to generate the summary statistics and analysis results.
 
The provided Python code simplifies the analysis of school and student data from PyCity Schools, enabling educators and administrators to gain valuable insights into educational performance. It can be customized to work with your specific dataset or expanded for more in-depth analysis and reporting.
